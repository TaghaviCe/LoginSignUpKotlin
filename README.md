An exercise to work with Api and retrofit in kotlin <br />
step 1:<br />
go to Xamp and Create new database( if you dont Xamp, you can install it)<br />
create table like this:<br />
I craete new database. Its name is Retrofit
and i create "user" table.<br />
The rows of the table are shown in the photo below<br />

step 2<br />
create "retrofit" folder on Xamp in in drive C <br />
Go to the following directory and create the "retrofit" folder.<br />
C:\xamp\htdocs

step 3<br />
go to retrofit folder and put your php code on it.<br />
here, you can find php codes in "retrofit" folder ->https://github.com/TaghaviCe/LoginSignUpKotlin/tree/master/retrofit.<br />

step 4:<br />
find your ip address on your pc<br />

step 5:<br />
Now you can see the code folders you put in the Xamp folder with your IP address.<br />
For example, if your IP is 198.168.X.X<br />
your URL is:  http://198.168.X.X/retrofit/ (use your url on your kotlin code)<br />
and you can see like this:<br />

step 6:<br />
Now you can test your Kotlin code and connect to Xamp via Api<br />
attention!: that both your mobile (or your emulator) and your PC must be connected to the same Wi-Fi to be able to communicate with each other based on your IP.<br/>

important points in kotlin code:<br/>
- MVVM architecture<br/>
- Moshi, Retrofit, Coroutine<br/>

Good Luck :)
