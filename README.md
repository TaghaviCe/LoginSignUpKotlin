step 2
create "retrofit" folder on Xamp in in drive C
Go to the following directory and create the "retrofit" folder.
C:\xamp\htdocs

step 3
go to retrofit folder and put your php code on it.

step 4:
find your ip address on your pc

step 5:
Now you can see the code folders you put in the Xamp folder with your IP address.
For example, if your IP is 198.168.1.4
your URL is:  http://198.168.1.4/retrofit/ (use your url on your kotlin code)
and you can see like this:

step 6:
Now you can test your Kotlin code and connect to Xamp via Api
Note that both your mobile (or your emulator) and your PC must be connected to the same Wi-Fi to be able to communicate with each other based on your IP.
